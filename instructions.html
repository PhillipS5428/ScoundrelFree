        <h2>Survival Guide</h2>
        <p>Welcome to the <strong>Endless Dungeons</strong>. Your goal is simple: navigate the entire deck of encounters without your health dropping to zero.</p>
        
        <h3>The Dungeon Deck</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Monsters (♣ & ♠):</strong> Dangerous foes. Their strength is their rank (2-10). Face cards are stronger: J=11, Q=12, K=13. <em>Aces are the strongest (14).</em></li>
            <li><strong>Shields (♦):</strong> Tools for survival. Equip and use them while attacking to take less damage.</li>
            <li><strong>The Sword (Ace of ♦):</strong> A legendary weapon. When equipped, it increases all your attacks by 1 for the rest of the game.</li>
            <li><strong>Potions (♥):</strong> Restore your health equal to their rank.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><em>Note: The dungeon is stripped of high-value resources. Red face cards (J, Q, K of ♥/♦) are removed from the deck.</em></p>
        
        <h3>Combat & Tactics</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>The Room:</strong> You face 4 cards at a time. You must play or defeat at least 3 of them to refill the room.</li>
            <li><strong>Quick Attack:</strong> You can always fight without a defense shield, but you will take damage equal to the monster's full strength. You take one less damage if you have the legendary sword!</li>
            <li><strong>Equipping Shields:</strong> Select a Diamond (2-10 value)to equip it. You can only hold one shield at a time; equipping a new one discards the old one.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Shield Mastery</h3>
        <p>Shields in Endless Dungeons have a unique <strong>Memory</strong> mechanic:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Victory:</strong> When you defeat a monster with a shield of equal or greater strength, you take no damage. However, your shield <em>dulls</em> or <em>sharpens</em> to match the strength of the defeated monster.</li>
            <li><strong>Overexertion (Training):</strong> You may attack a monster stronger than your current shield <strong>once</strong> per equipped shield. You take the difference in damage, and your shield's strength rises to match the monster.</li>
            <li><strong>Limit:</strong> Once a shield has been Overexerted (trained up), it cannot be used to attack stronger monsters again. It can only slay weaker foes, slowly losing power with every victory.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Strategic Retreat</h3>
        <p>If a room is too dangerous, you may <strong>Flee</strong>. All 4 cards are shuffled to the bottom of the deck. You cannot flee twice in a row; you must face the next room.</p>
