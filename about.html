    <main>
        <p>Endless Dungeons is a strategic web-based dungeon crawler played with a standard deck of cards. Survive the endless depths by managing your health and weapon durability.</p>
        <p>Endless Dungeons was inspired by the classic card game Scoundrel. After enjoying many rounds, the desire to create a more accessible version led to the development of this game. The gameplay has evolved significantly from its roots, with new mechanics like the sword system and shield durability mechanics added to create a deeper strategic experience. The result is a unique dungeon crawler that captures the essence of deck-based roguelikes while offering its own distinct flavor.</p>
        <p>This game was created by Phillip Simmons, a passionate developer aiming to create a simple yet engaging strategy game that can be played anywhere. Phillip lives in Colorado Springs, Colorado with his wife Elizabeth and two children.</p>
